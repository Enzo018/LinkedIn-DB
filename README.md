Welcome to the code for an interactive CLI to manage a database detailing information about over 30,000+ LinkedIn job postings and companies!

The code for the CLI can be found in the Deliverable2.py file. Note that the connection in this program is done through psycopg2, which connects it to a postgreSQL database. 
It is also important to know that the information for login is hardcoded into the file and must be changed in case you want to use it.

The raw csv data files that were used for the creation of the tables that are accessed by the CLI can be found in the "Raw Data" folder.
The information that is in each of the tables that were created for the sake of this CLI is included in the "My Tables" folder.
Unfortunately, a csv file for each of these folders was too big to include in the repository, but I can provide accesses to it personally if necessary.

Lastly, all SQL commands necessary for the creation of the tables in a postgreSQL environment are included in the "SQL Table Creation" folder.

Thank you very much for your time and attention, enjoy using the CLI!
